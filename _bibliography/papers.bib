To identify the improvement potential in the operation of a device, precise characterization is crucial. This paper presents a flexible and easily reconfigurable test setup to characterize the dynamic behavior of SiC MOSFETs under both hard- and soft-switching conditions at blocking voltages of up to 900 V and currents up to 300 A. It features a balancing circuit that enables long term test operation in both switching modes and as a future power cycling test setup.},

	abstract = {For efficient converter design, modeling of switching components must be both accurate and fast. A variety of simulation models for SiC Power MOSFETs has been developed. To achieve adequate accuracy, models are adjusted to experimental data by applying fitting methods. However, proposed universal fitting methods result in high-dimensional optimization problems. Their computational inefficiency leads to either long run times or low accuracy. This paper proposes a new universal parameter fitting method that is at least twice as fast and yields a more accurate outcome than presented methods under comparable conditions. It effectively reduces the dimensionality of the parameter fitting optimization problem by sensitivity-based reduction of optimization parameters. Thereby, it optimizes both model adjustment speed and accuracy, which are critical factors for an efficient converter design process. The method does not compromise flexibility as it is universally applicable to any SPICE model and can meet any model architecture preference.},

This paper presents a low inductive test platform for devices in a TO-247-3 housing. The test platform contains measurement terminals for high bandwidth measurement of both current and voltage. The experiments presented in this paper prove that high-fidelity dynamic characterization data can be obtained from Double-Pulse Tests (DPTs) using the presented test platform.

The dynamic switching model utilizes the Shichman and Hodges equations using voltage-dependent nonlinear device capacitances and module electrical parameters to obtain an accurate dynamic model of the device switching transients. The key device states that gate–source voltage, drain current, and drain–source voltage are modeled. This article investigates the impact of correct device capacitance modeling with low off-state gate–source voltage values, impacting the device capacitances and causes gate-voltage hysteresis effects. It has been shown that the presented discrete-time dynamic switching model accurately describes the turn-on transient and the results highlight the importance of correct capacitance and threshold voltage characterization data. The modeling results are compared with experimental measurements conducted in a 3.3 kV/750 A SiC mosfet power module. The model exhibits an average accuracy of \${\textbackslash}sim 4\%\$ for turn-on energy and \${\textbackslash}sim 1.3\%\$ for the turn-on time compared with measurements. These models are valuable for rapid and cost effective design and validation of advanced gate-driver circuits and for determining key design and operating parameters, such as dead time, switching frequency, and switching losses.},

	abstract = {Silicon Carbide power semiconductors exhibit fast dynamic behavior. This facilitates the design of high efficiency and high power density converters. However, the resulting current and voltage changing rates demand extensive filtering to avoid electromagnetic interference and ensure safe operation. In addition, temperature fluctuations due to varying load currents from renewable energy sources pose challenges for power semiconductor device lifetime and reliability. Active temperature control can reduce temperature fluctuations, but affects switching slopes simultaneously. This leads to variable electrical stress on both device and circuit level. In this paper, a four-level active voltage-source gate driver for SiC MOSFETs is proposed, enabling manipulation of switching and conduction losses. Switching losses are manipulated by controlling the duration as well as amplitude of intermediate gate voltage pulses during switching transients. Conduction losses can be influenced by adjusting the positive gate voltage. Simulations indicate that the proposed gate driver allows decoupling switching loss and slope control. To validate the gate driver concept, a prototype has been built and evaluated in double pulse test experiments.},

With switching times of few nanoseconds, the unprecedented switching speed of SiC semiconductor devices challenges today's converter and characterization setup designs in regard to parasitic layout inductances for optimal conversion and reliable characterization data. Fur-thermore, active gate driving is a key to unlock the potential of SiC MOSFETs, but requires performance assessment prior to integration. This paper presents a low-inductive test platform for flexible and high-accuracy characterization of fast-switching SiC MOSFETs and active gate drivers evalu-ation. The test circuit delivers high quality characterization data that is comparable with a commercial dynamic power device characterizer. In addition to the conventional hard-switching double-pulse tests with a two-level voltage source gate driver, the test circuit offers soft-switching and gate driver evaluation capability in addition. This test platform is a valuable tool for obtaining reliable characterization data to develop more accurate SiC MOSFET simulation models, and evaluate the combination of gate driver and MOSFET prior to the prototyping phase of a converter.},

	abstract = {Silicon Carbide (SiC) powerMetal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) bear the potential of revolutionizing power electronic converters in regard to high efficiency, but also high power density converters and converter in harsh environmental conditions. These devices switch at unprecedented speed that can easily cause interference and risk to the surrounding circuitry.
Power MOSFETs require gate driver circuits to be switched on or off. Conventionally, Two Level Voltage Source Gate Drivers (VSGDs) have been used to realize this functionality. However, both the static and dynamic behavior of SiC powerMOSFETs strongly depends on the operating conditions, such as DC voltage and load current. Two Level VSGDs cannot account for these changes, which results in suboptimal utilization of the powerMOSFETs in a wide range of operating conditions.
Active Gate Drivers (AGDs), as opposed to conventional Two Level VSGDs, can be adjusted during the run time of the converter and therefore adapt the powerMOSFET behavior to changing operating conditions. AGDs will therefore be of major importance to optimally utilize the advantages of SiC power MOSFETs in future power converters.
This work presents contributions concerning the accurate dynamic SiC powerMOSFET characterization, AGD design and evaluation methodologies by means of two concrete examples, as well as control signal delivery to AGDs.
The outcomes in these three subtopics are:
• A Low-Inductive Test Platform for accurate dynamic characterization of SiC powerMOSFETs driven by conventional or active gate drivers,
• TwoMultilevel Voltage Source Gate Drivers (MLVSGDs) offering switching slope and loss control as well as synchronous rectifier overshootvoltage suppression, and
• A systematic method ofWireless Communication Technology (WCT) adaptation in Power Electronics Systems (PES) demonstrated by the example of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for wireless control of an MLVSGD.},
