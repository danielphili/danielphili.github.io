Hi, I am Daniel, thanks for stopping by!

By training, I am a Power Electronics Engineer. In the past, I have focused on high power-density design of DCDC converters for automotive applications (M.Sc.) and active gate driving strategies for low and medium voltage Silicon Carbide power MOSFETs (PhD). Recently I have diverted slightly from the narrow power electronics focus and started working with UBIQ Aerospace, who supply electrothermal de-icing solutions for airborne systems.
